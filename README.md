# Mood-Based-Music-Player
The main concept of this project is to automatically play songs based on the emotions of
the user. It aims to provide user-preferred music with emotion awareness. In existing
system user want to manually select the songs, randomly played songs may not match to
the mood of the user, user has to classify the songs into various emotion and then for
playing the songs user has to manually select a particular emotion. These difficulties can be
avoided by using MOOD BASED MUSIC PLAYER.
